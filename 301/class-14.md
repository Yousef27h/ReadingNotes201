# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?

The same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

These early personal computers weren't much more than toys. You could play pong or simple shooting games, maybe do some word processing. And these toys were marketed almost entirely to men and boys.

This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative. It became the story we told ourselves about the computing revolution. It helped define who geeks were, and it created techie culture.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

Because when they grow up they would already know alot of things that would help them to stand out.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

Because diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result.
