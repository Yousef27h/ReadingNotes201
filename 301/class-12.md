# SQL vs NoSQL

## Reading Questions

| SQL | NoSQL |
|-----|-----|
| table based databases | document based, key-value pairs, graph databases|
| have predefined schema | have dynamic schema |
| vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |
| uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data | uses UnQL (Unstructured Query Language) |
| not best fit for hierarchical data storage | fits better for the hierarchical data storage |

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

table based data.

2. Give a real world example.

Oracle Express Edition

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.

4. Give a real world example.

MongoDB

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL database

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?

SQL database

## Video Questions 

1. What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language.

2. What is a realational database?

It's a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?

works with tables.

4. What is a ‘schema’?

A cognitive framework or concept that helps organize and interpret information.

5. What is a NoSQL database?

An approach to database design that provides flexible schemas for the storage and retrieval of data beyond the traditional table structures found in relational databases.

6. Howo does it work?

We have databases just like SQL, but it's dynamic, which means it's not a table database but collections that contain documents.

7. What is inside of a Mongo database?

We have collections instead of tables, and inside collections we have documents.

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB, because it has no specific schema. Also, there are no relations

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

when you want to update a spcific data, you have to update all collections that contain that data.

## Differences between SQL & NoSQL



- SQL databases are called Relational Databases, whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

- SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.

- SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

- SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

- SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.

- SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.

- For the type of data to be stored: SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage. But, NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.
