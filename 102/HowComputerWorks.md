We deal with computer on daily basis, at home, at work, in the car, etc.. . but we never asked how computer works. In this page we gonna explain how computers work.

before along time, humans made machines that can control physical things and move them, to make humans life easier. But with time people started to think about a machine to control information.
they realised computers have to make 4 different actions:
1. Take input
2. Storage information
3. process it 
4. output the results

Inside the computer are wires and circuts that carry all the information in a computer. even though nobody deals with them anymore, but zeros and ones are the basic that builds information. and those zeros and one actually are electricity being turned ON and OFF, which is called a **BIT**.
Each number for example in decimal format (0-9) is being represented by set of zeros and ones, but no one actually convert it manually, because the computer does the work for us. The same goes for texts.

We control those electric signals using circuts, there are many shapes of them which enable us to control the flow of the electricity.
circuits can do all mathmetical operations, such as multiplication, addition, subtraction, etc.. .
