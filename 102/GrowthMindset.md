# GrowthMindset
explanation of growth mindset and how to keep yourself in a growth mindset

## What is a growth mindset?
a growth mindset is the belive that anyone can improve their abilities by hardwork and effort. being smart and talented is just a starting point.
On the other hand, a fixed mindset one's abilities and performance depends mainly on his intellegence level without putting any further efforts, and success only comes from inherent qualities.

here's a simple illustration to help you distinguish between growth and fixed mindsets:

and here are some situations that you may stuck in *Fixed mindset* phase, and suggestions on how to convert it into *Growth Mindset* :

1- **Challenges**

  when you try to learn something knew, you'll probably face something that you feel it's so hard and complicated and you can't do it, in that moment you'll be in *fixed mindset* phase, In this kind of situation what you want to do is just take a rest then comeback to the same problem and just look at the whole problem to get the picture, then try to analyz it piece by piece till you move on and find the solution, sometimes it help to talk through these steps - out loud. soon enough you'll reach to the root cause of the problem.
  
2- **Obstacles**
  
  usually when we face a problem, we tend to do something else and just not think about it whether it's grapping out a cup of coffee, or just about anything to delay keeping at it.The solution as Robert Persig says in *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*, is to stand up, put down whatever project is sucking the gumption out of you, walk away, and return when you’re feeling more inspired. 
Now this isn't always the suitable solution, especially when you're at work. but realising what's happening ( Avoiding and losing focus), helps you in making peace with it, and trying to un-trap enough of your gumption to do one more thing on the project, then another thing, then another. until enough momentum will build up and keeps you going.

3- **Criticism**

  usually when your day ends you start to think of what you have done, and think about all the wasted time and things you did wrong. two questions will help you get full benefit out of your day 
  - What was the best part of the day?
  - What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again?

These questions help you focus on all aspects of my day, the good and the bad, and they help you internalize strategies for creating more good days going forward.
also you can change those question to help you process your coworkers criticism for example, such as:
  - Which aspects of my work am I most proud of?
  - What can I do to improve the aspects I’m less proud of?
