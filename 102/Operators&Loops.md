# Comparison Operators

You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will be a Boolean: **true** or **false**.

- **==** : is equal to 

This operator compares two values(numbers, strings, or Booleans) to see if they are the same.

- **===** : strict equal to

This operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same.

- **!=** : is not equal to

This operator compares two values (numbers,strings, or Booleans) to see if they are *not* the same.

- **!==** : strict not equal to

This operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are _not_ the same.

- **>** : greater than

This operator checks if the number on the left is *greater* than the number on the right.

- **>=** : greater than or equal to

This operator checks if the number on the left is *greater* than or *equal* to the number on the right.

- **<** : less than

This operator checks if the number on the left is *less* than the number on the right.

- **<=** : less than or equal to

This operator checks if the number on the left is *less* than or equal to the number on the right.

# Logical Operators

Comparison operators usually retun single values of **true** or **false**.
Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

`((5 < 2) && (2 >= 3))`

# Loops

Loops check a condition. if it returns **true**, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns **true**, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns **false**. 
There are three common types of loops:

- **FOR** 

If you need to run code a specific number of times, use a **for** loop.

- **WHILE**

If you do not know how many times the code should run, you can use a **while** loop.

- **DO WHILE**

The **do...while** loop is very similar to the **while** loop, but has one key difference: it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to **false**.
