# Images

You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box. 

By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a block-level element using the display property with a value of block. 

Once it has been made into a block-level element, there are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image:

1. On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center.

2. On the containing element, you can use the text-alignproperty with a value of center.

The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.

When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-position property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed. 

Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it (known as a __rollover__) and a third style when they click on it. 

# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords (the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order to improve its findability.

1. Page Title
2. URL / Web Address
3. Headings
4. Text
5. Link Text
6. Image Alt Text
7. Page Descriptions


# Domain names & Hosting

In order to put your site on the web you will need a domain name and web hosting.

Your domain name is your web address (e.g. google.com or bbc.co.uk). There are many websites that allow you to register domain names. Usually you will have to pay an annual fee to keep that domain name.

So that other people can see your site, you will need to upload it to a web server. Web servers are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet. They are specially set up to serve web pages when they are requested.

# FTP & Third Party Tools

To transfer your code and images from your computer to your hosting company, you use something known as File Transfer Protocol.

File Transfer Protocol (or FTP) allows you to transfer files across the Internet from your computer to the web server hosting your site.
