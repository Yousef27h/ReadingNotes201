# How The Web Works

When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

**firstly,** When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). You type a 
domain name or web address into your browser to visit a site; for example: google.com, bbc.co.uk, microsoft.com.

**Secondly,** Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books; they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name. 
An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods / full stops. Every device connected to the web has a unique IP address; it is like the phone number for that computer. 

**Third,** The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you 
requested. A web server is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users.

**lastly,** The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.

## HTML & CSS

In a webpage, **HTML** represents the structure of the page, **CSS** the styling and appearance of the webpage, and **JavaScripts** controls the interactive actions.

In HTML code, the page contains basically DOCTYPE tag which defines the file type, head tag that defines informations for browsers and search engines and does not appear to the user, body tag contains the content of the webpage that the user sees, and html tag that defines the code inside of it.


HTML elements are added to the content of a pgae to describe its structure. An element consists of the opening and closing tags, plus its content.

`<p class="fruit">peach</p>`

**CSS** uses rules to indicate how the contents of one or more elements should be displayed in the browser. Each rule has a selector and a declaration block. 
The CSS selector indicates which element(s) the rules applies to. The declaration block contains rules the indicate how those elements should appear.

It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return. **Site maps** allow you to plan the structure of a site. **Wireframes** allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page. Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.




## JavaScript

JavaScript allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser. It can make the web page feel interactive by responding to what the user does.

A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. 
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
