# Text

HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs). They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation)

HTML has six levels of headings : 

**h1** is used for main headings, **h2** is used for subheadings. If there are further sections under the subheadings then **h3** element is used, and so on...

**p** tag is used to create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening and closing tags.

By enclosing words in the **b** element, we can make characters appear bold. Also By enclosing words in the *i* element, we can make characters appear italic.


The use of the **strong** element indicates that its 
content has strong importance. For example, the words contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis.

There are two elements commonly used for marking up quotations:
- The __blockquote__ element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. 

- The __q__ element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph. 


When you are referencing a piece of work such as a book, film or research paper, the **cite** element can be used to indicate where the citation is from.

# CSS

The key to understanding how **CSS** works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.**CSS** allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements.These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a **property** and a **value**, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, eachseparated by a semi-colon.

# JavaScript

A **script** is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a **statement**. Statements should end with a semicolon. 

You should write **comments** to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code. 

A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in **variables**.

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (NUMERIC DATA TYPE), strings (STRING DATA TYPE), and true or false values known as Booleans (BOOLEAN DATA TYPE). 

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).
