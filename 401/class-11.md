# Spring

The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications.


In building web applications, HTTP requests are handled by a controller. A controller is identified by `@controller`.

`@GetMapping` ensures that HTTP GET requests to specific end point are mapped to a specific method.

_Thymeleaf_ renders the HTML page.

Adding spring model attributes can be done by adding attribute to `Model`.
