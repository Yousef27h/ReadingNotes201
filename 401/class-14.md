# Trees

- Binary tree: is a data structure made of nodes, where each node contains a "left" reference, a "right" reference, and a data element.

- Node : nodes are like containers, in which we store our elements inside and has links to other nodes.

- Root : the topmost node in the tree, or in another words the node at the start of tree.

- K : the maximum number of connected nodes below each node in tree.

- Left : A reference to children nodes depends on type of tree.

- Right : A reference to children nodes depends on type of tree.

- Height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf. The height of a tree is a height of the root.

- Depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.

- Edge : refers to the link between parent and child nodes.

- Leaf : is a node that does not have any nodes below (children) in the tree.
