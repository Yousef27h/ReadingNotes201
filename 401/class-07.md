# OO Design

_SOLID_ refers to five object-oriented design principles:

## S - Single-resposibility Principle

A class should have one job only. If there is a class that does more than one job it would violate the single-resposibility principle.

## O - Open-Closed Principle


Objects should be extendable (be able to to inherit from) without modifying the class itself ( by keep editing the methods depending on input).

Instead we can simply create class carries method related to specific input.

## L - Liskov Substitution Principle


Every class should be able to being substituded with it's parent class.

## I - Interface Segregation Principle

A class shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use always.


## D - Dependency Inversion Principle

It states that high level class shouldn't depend on low-level classes.
