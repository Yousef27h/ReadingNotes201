## Many To Many RelationShip

A many-to-many relationship occurs when multiple records in a table are associated with multiple records in another table. For example, a many-to-many relationship exists between customers and products: customers can purchase various products, and products can be purchased by many customers.

A typical example of a many-to many relationship is one between students and classes. A student can register for many classes, and a class can include many students.

## Points from James Mickens article

- Security people need to get their priorities straight, because they see everything around them as a threat and the only provably safe activity is to stare at a horseshoe.

- Security researchers are always trying to combat security issues, and always trrying to make better system with no flaws that are more secure. 

- There is no such a thing called a "perfect security system" , no matter how strong of a security system it will be eventually hacked.

- To make things more safe, information flow control and security labels are employed.
