# Intent Filers

Intent filters specifies the types of intents that an activity, service, or broadcast receiver can respond to. An intent filter declares the capabilities of its parent component â€” what an activity or service can do and what types of broadcasts a receiver can handle. It opens the component to receiving intents of the advertised type, while filtering out those that are not meaningful for the component.

When you create an implicit intent, the Android system finds the appropriate component to start by comparing the contents of the intent to the intent filters declared in the manifest file of other apps on the device. If the intent matches an intent filter, the system starts that component and delivers it the Intent object.

To advertise which implicit intents our app can receive, declare one or more intent filters for each of your app components with an <intent-filter> element in our manifest file. Each intent filter specifies the type of intents it accepts based on the intent's action, data, and category. The system delivers an implicit intent to our app component only if the intent can pass through one of our intent filters.
