# OOP

## Objects

There are two characteristics for objects: _state_ and _behavior_.

The object stores its state in _fields_ (which they are like variables in other programming languages) and its behavior through methods (functions in some programming languages).

**Data encapsulation** is hiding object's state and using it's methods to perform it's interactions.

Object's methods  are used for changing it's state, and one's can control which values to accept for it's states.

benefits of using object oriented programming:

1- Modularity
2- Information-hiding
3- Code re-use
4- Pluggability and debugging ease

 ## Class

A class is like a blueprint for creating objects of the same category.

A class that doesn't contain _main_ method is only used to create object to be used inside an _application_.

We can create sub-class, which will inherit all the fields and methods of the main class, and could add new fields and methods, class can only be a subclass for only one superclass.

We can add modifiers to the beginning of class declaration such as _public_ and _private_.


## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

### Decimals

Every digit in a decimal number has a "position", and the decimal point helps us to know which position is which. The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10".

Number that is located to the left of the decimal point is in "Ones" Position, further to the left is x10 times bigger for every position, and every position to the right of the decimal is 10 times smaller.




### Binary Numbers

Binary Numbers are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits ... so you start back at 0 again, but increase the number on the left by 1.

### Hexadecimal Numbers

They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.


So the general rule is : Count up until just before the "Base Number", then start at 0 again, but first you add 1 to the number on your left.
