# Location

One of the unique features of mobile applications is location awareness. Mobile users take their devices with them everywhere, and adding location awareness to your app offers users a more contextual experience. The location APIs available in Google Play services facilitate adding location awareness to your app with automated location tracking, wrong-side-of-the-street detection, geofencing, and activity recognition.

To protect user privacy, apps that use location services must request location permissions.


Android's location permissions deal with the following categories of location access:

- Foreground location
- Background location

Google Play services provides a number of APIs and core device services that enable Android to be a feature-rich, connected platform. 

Using the Google Play services location APIs, our app can request the last known location of the user's device.
