# Android Fundamentals

Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages. Then the compiler (android SDK tools) compile the code into an APK (`.apk` suffix) or an Android app Bundle (`.aab` suffix).


Android security features:

- In Android operating system each app is a different user.

-  The system sets permissions for all the files in an app so that only the user ID assigned to that app can access them.

- Each app's code runs in isolation from other apps.


The Android system implements the principle of least privilege. That is, each app, by default, has access only to the components that it requires to do its work and no more.

To create more secure environment, Android system implements the _principle of least privilege_, which is each app has access only to the components that it requires to do its work and no more.
