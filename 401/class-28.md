# Graphs

Terminology:

- Vertex: also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- Edge : one of the basic units of which graphs are constructed. Each edge has two vertices to which it is attached, called its endpoints.
- Two vertices are called adjacent if they are endpoints of the same edge.
- The degree of a vertex in a graph is the total number of edges incident to it.
- Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- Cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
- Forest is a graph without cycles.
- A bridge is an edge whose removal would disconnect the graph.
