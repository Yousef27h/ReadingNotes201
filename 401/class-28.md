# Monetization

To maximize revenue, you should consider a monetization strategy that suits to your audiences and market.

There are two primary ways to sell goods or services through an app: Google Play's billing system and Google Pay.

1- Sell digital goods or services with Google Play's billing system

Google Play's billing system is easy to use, secure. The users only have to save a payment method on Google Play, and then they can use that same payment method for all future payments on Google Play with ease.

While developers on the other hand, are required to use Google Play's billing system to sell-in app content. Items that require developers to use Google Play's billing system include the following:

- Virtual game products
- App functionality or content
- Subscription services
- Cloud software products

2- Sell physical goods or services with Google Pay

Use Google PAy to sell service and physical products outside the app. Products where we recommend developers use Google Pay include the following:

- Retail merchandise
- Physical services
- One-time membership fees or recurring dues
- Electronic bill payment


Other ways to monetize an app :

- Advertising : get paid for showing ads.
- Paid apps : set a price that a user must pay in order to download the app.
